# Extreme Weather Case Studies  
### Comparing Hurricane Sandy (2012) & Hurricane Ida (2021) – New York City

## Project Overview  
This project analyzes and compares the impacts of two major storms – Hurricane Sandy and Hurricane Ida – on New York City. Using maps, rainfall/storm-surge visualizations, and narrative research, we explore how different kinds of extreme weather (coastal storm surge vs. inland flooding) threaten urban communities.
